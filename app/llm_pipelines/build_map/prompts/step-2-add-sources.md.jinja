## Step 2. Add sources 

For each concept in the hierarchy, write its source file.
Use the file path from the name property in the YAML metadata block for each file.
Note: If the file appears to be a well-structured Markdown document with proper headings, add #Header-1#...#Header-n to refer to the very specific section related to the concept.

### Response format 
Follow this json schema:
```json
{{ json_schema }}
```
