# Instruction

Using the following material, perform the following tasks:

## Step 1. Build a Hierarchy

### Concept Extraction

A Concept is a distinct unit of knowledge that represents an idea, skill, or topic which can be taught or learned.
Every Concept must have an unique name so it can be clearly identified and referenced.
Extract concepts from the given material.
1. Uniqueness: Assign each concept a unique, unambiguous name or label so it can be clearly identified.
2. Scope: Focus on concepts that are learnable, such as theories, processes, and entities.  
3. Style & wording: use concept names/terms/topics, without any explanation, descriptions, of definitions and any additional markup, underscores. 

### Concept Hierarchy

Arrange all extracted concepts into a well-organized hierarchy.  
- Start with a small number of general **root concepts**.  
- Continue with more specific concepts as you move to the lower levels.
- Stop if there node which can't be expanded further, left it as a leaft string node, do not add empty list of children.
- There can't be multiple keys with same name, are keys are unique.
  instead of `a: [b, c], c: [d, e]` use `a: [b, c: [d, e]]`
- Maintain a balanced depth (3â€“5 levels in hierarchy) and well-organized hierarchy. 

### Response format

When constructing hierarchy, strictly follow this json schema:

```json
{{ json_schema }}
```
